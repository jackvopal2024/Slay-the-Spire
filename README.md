# Slay-the-Spire
This was a super fun final project for Freshman Year CompSci!
Completed 5/2/24

For my Midterm project, I did the default project with some pretty basic stretch goals. Needless to say, when an instructor gives me freedom I should probably challenge myself a bit more, especially in the field of my major. This is why my partner, Tristan, and I created an RPG. The game is closely based on a card game called Slay the Spire and gives the user an experience where he or she can fight attackers/bosses using attacks, blocks, effects, and more. Although I was unfamiliar with the game beforehand, it was still a fun challenge.
	As with any large project, if we had a bit more time there are some improvements that we could implement. For instance, the handling of card drawing and shuffling could be streamlined to improve efficiency and reduce redundant code. By refactoring these functions and optimizing their performance, the game's responsiveness and fluidity would increase, providing players with a smoother and more enjoyable experience. Additionally, adding error handling and input validation mechanisms to prevent unexpected behavior would improve the gameâ€™s stability. This includes validating user input to ensure it falls within acceptable ranges and handling corner cases gracefully.
	In conclusion, this project was significant on a career level, as it helped convince me to make the switch to a Major in Comp-Sci. Working on something that challenged me more than the default sparked my interest in things that I would have never expected, such as operating networks and systems. On the other hand, this project helped let me know that I am not quite as interested in game design. Either way, I am excited to take more coding classes next year and do more projects!
